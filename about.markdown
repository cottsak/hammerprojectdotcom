Hey, my name is Matt.

I have a severe allergy to [complicated software](/2023/07/28/complexity.html).

I also joke about nearly everything. Except of course when it comes to complicated software ðŸ‘†.

This blog is just a collection of my thoughts and an open experiment about [writing/learning/growing in public](https://github.com/cottsak/hammerprojectdotcom/commits/master). Hope you find something useful, or at least mildly entertaining.
