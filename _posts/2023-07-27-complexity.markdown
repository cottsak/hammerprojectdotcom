I don't remember how but I stumbled onto [grugbrain.dev](https://grugbrain.dev) last week.

It's gold. 

I could literally end this post on the line above. But I did wonder about how junior devs might find this content. I personally find it to be amazingly written. It's just my kind of comedy with a dash of WAKE THE FUK UP NEO! 😆 But I'm not exactly sure whether a green engineer will understand much of it and gain the most value possible. So I wanted to add some of my thoughts. The following is just a commentary. I don't want to subtract anything at all, but if I'm lucky, maybe unpack things for a less-seasoned audience. 

Let's start with this section --

## The Eternal Enemy: Complexity

> apex predator of grug is complexity

Complexity is quite literally the biggest threat to any software engineer and all of software engineering. Why? Well I'll try to uncover that below and close with a few of my own thoughts at the end.

> complexity bad  

Don't misunderstand this point. It's worth repeating. 

I actually struggled to agree with this a little and it was largely "semantics". But semantics are important because they convey meaning. Don't let someone criticise you because you're "getting hung up on semantics" - people who get hung up on semantics usually care about clarity. This might mean that they want to understand things deeply. Don't miss an opportunity to work with someone like this. 

There is this narrative in the software engineering community that roughly tries to draw a distinction between **complexity** and that which is **complicated**. That alone deserves a post all on it's own, but the short version for me is that I'm now ok with allowing them to exist in the same container. There might be an occasional reason why complexity is necessary. This is usually the hang up - how can you avoid something that you need? Now I wonder if this is just another problem solving activity. 

If you think you truly need complexity `n`, then try to design it out. Try to reduce `n` or delete it altogether. Remember, "[the best part is no part](https://hammerproject.com/2022/11/17/smashing-entropy.html)".

Say it out loud even. If the guy across the desk from you gives you one of those "what a weirdo" looks, then link them to this post. Just be like "he hold me too" while pointing at your screen. 

> given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex

The subtlety here is that complexity can often be hard to recognise. This is especially terrifying when you realise that complexity is kinda glorified in our industry, particularly among younger engineers who are out to prove themselves. It's like lifting at the gym: if you can lift something heavy, you're cool right? Well, if you can build something hard, or solve a hard problem, or a complex problem, then you're cool right? Just get your flex on and show the world how great you are...?? 🤷‍♂️ I'm not saying that some engineers try to hide complexity on purpose. But there is a large cultural incentive to add it and because it hides in dark corners and is hard to see, its a very real problem. 

I can't train you how to spot complexity. It comes mostly with time. But one signal is pain. If something feels harder than it should, then maybe it's too complex. Of course this is pretty subjective and a "gut feel" kind of thing. But soon you will learn to notice the sensation. Listen to it. [Search your peelings](https://youtu.be/hVrIyEu6h_E?t=266).

> complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable non grug-brain developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime

> one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good!

> next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!

> grug no able see complexity demon, but grug sense presence in code base

> demon complexity spirit mocking him make change here break unrelated thing there what!?! mock mock mock ha ha so funny grug love programming and not becoming shiney rock speculator like grug senior advise

> club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who let spirit in with club: sometimes grug himself!

> sadly, often grug himself

> so grug say again and say often: complexity very, very bad
