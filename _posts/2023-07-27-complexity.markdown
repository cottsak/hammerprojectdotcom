I don't remember how but I stumbled onto [grugbrain.dev](https://grugbrain.dev) last week.

It's gold. 

I could literally end this post on the line above. But I did wonder about how junior devs might find this content. I personally find it to be amazingly written. It's just my kind of comedy with a dash of WAKE THE FUK UP NEO! ğŸ˜† But I'm not exactly sure whether a green engineer will understand much of it and gain the most value possible. So I wanted to add some of my thoughts. The following is just a commentary. I don't want to subtract anything at all, but if I'm lucky, maybe unpack things for a less-seasoned audience. 

Let's start with this section --

## The Eternal Enemy: Complexity

> apex predator of grug is complexity

Complexity is quite literally the biggest threat to any software engineer and all of software engineering. Why? Well I'll try to uncover that below and close with a few of my own thoughts at the end.

> complexity bad  

> say again:  
> complexity very bad  
> you say now:  
> complexity very, very bad

> given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex

> complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable non grug-brain developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime

> one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good!

> next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation!

> grug no able see complexity demon, but grug sense presence in code base

> demon complexity spirit mocking him make change here break unrelated thing there what!?! mock mock mock ha ha so funny grug love programming and not becoming shiney rock speculator like grug senior advise

> club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who let spirit in with club: sometimes grug himself!

> sadly, often grug himself

> so grug say again and say often: complexity very, very bad
